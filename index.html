        <h2>Charlie </h2>
        <h3>Organizer</h3>
        <p>Hi, my name is Charlie and I just graduated high school and I am going to the University of Washington - Seattle campus.</p>
        <p>When I was a high school student, I worked with a lot of adolescents and infants.</p>
        <p>As a high school volunteer in the hospital, I’ve encountered infants who struggle with neuroblastoma cancer. </p>
        <p>Because of the expenses, his parents worked round the clock and tried to support the expenses.</p>
        <p>Every year around 15,000 children are diagnosed with cancer and 10% of diagnosed children died.</p>
        <p>I organized “Agape” because of these reasons</p>
        <p>We as an Agape member, we want to use the knowledge that we learned in school to help our societies and help children and adolescents achieve their dream: becoming an adult.</p>

        <h2>Tiffany Kim</h2>
        <h3>Business team leader</h3>
        <p>Hi, my name is Tiffany Kim.</p>
        <p>I graduated from Curtis High School, and I am now enrolled at University of Washington as a Freshman majoring in Business Administration.</p>
        <p>As a high school student, I volunteered at local Korean schools as a teacher assistant.</p>
        <p>Although working with children required a lot of energy and patience, watching children learn and grow motivated me to volunteer even more.</p>
        <p>It was also heartwarming to see smiles from children who were excited to learn.</p>
        <p>Through “Agape” we look forward to sharing our love and seeing those beautiful smiles on children across the nation.</p>

        <h2>Annabelle Chang</h2>
        <h3>Medical/Events team leader</h3>
        <p>Hello my name is Annabelle Chang and I am a senior at Curtis Senior High school.</p>
        <p>I volunteer at Mary Bridge Childrens hospital and have fell in love with children's health.</p>
        <p>My job is to entertain and care for the children's comfort needs.</p>
        <p>It is a joy to help some of these kids by brightening their day a little bit.</p>
        <p>However, to have the opportunity to aid some of these same type of children in direct financial support, is a huge leap and can make an enormous difference in the lives of some struggling families.</p>
        <p>It is a very impactful type of support that I will be able to provide for these children.</p>
        <p>I hope we will be able to reach as many children as possible and that our work will not be diminished.</p>
        <p>I am excited for this project and am optimistic for the future of Agape</p>
