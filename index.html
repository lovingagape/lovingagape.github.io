        <h2>Charlie</h2>
        <h3>Organizer</h3>
        <p>Hi, my name is Charlie and I just graduated high school and I am going to the University of Washington - Seattle campus.</p>
        <br>
         <p>When I was a high school student, I worked with a lot of adolescents and infants.</p>
         <br>
         <p>As a high school volunteer in the hospital, I’ve encountered infants who struggle with neuroblastoma cancer. Because of the expenses, his parents worked round the clock and tried to support the expenses. Every year around 15,000 children are diagnosed with cancer and 10% of diagnosed children died. I organized “Agape” because of these reasons We as an Agape member, we want to use the knowledge that we learned in school to help our societies and help children and adolescents achieve their dream: becoming an adult.</p>
