        <h2>Charlie</h2>
        <h3>Organizer</h3>
        <p>Hi, my name is Charlie and I just graduated high school and I am going to the University of Washington - Seattle campus.</p>
        <p>When I was a high school student, I worked with a lot of adolescents and infants.</p>
        <p>As a high school volunteer in the hospital, I’ve encountered infants who struggle with neuroblastoma cancer. Because of the expenses, his parents worked round the clock and tried to support the expenses. Every year around 15,000 children are diagnosed with cancer and 10% of diagnosed children died. I organized “Agape” because of these reasons We as an Agape member, we want to use the knowledge that we learned in school to help our societies and help children and adolescents achieve their dream: becoming an adult.</p>
        <h2>Tiffany Kim</h2>
        <h3></h3>
        <p>Hi, my name is Tiffany Kim. I graduated from Curtis High School, and I am now enrolled at University of Washington as a Freshman majoring in Business Administration. As a high school student, I volunteered at local Korean schools as a teacher assistant. Although working with children required a lot of energy and patience, watching children learn and grow motivated me to volunteer even more. It was also heartwarming to see smiles from children who were excited to learn. Through “Agape” we look forward to sharing our love and seeing those beautiful smiles on children across the nation.</p>
        <h2>Annabelle Chang</h2>
        <h3></h3>
        <p>Hello my name is Annabelle Chang and I am a senior at Curtis Senior High school. I volunteer at Mary Bridge Childrens hospital and have fell in love with children's health. My job is to entertain and care for the children's comfort needs. It is a joy to help some of these kids by brightening their day a little bit. However, to have the opportunity to aid some of these same type of children in direct financial support, is a huge leap and can make an enormous difference in the lives of some struggling families. It is a very impactful type of support that I will be able to provide for these children. I hope we will be able to reach as many children as possible and that our work will not be diminished. I am excited for this project and am optimistic for the future of Agape</p>
